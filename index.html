			Once when I was <sub> 13 years young </sub> my mother confessed that she <em>almost</em>  loved me more than she loved bread. <br> With her eyes closed, she swayed back in forth in rapture, professing her love for bread in the key of <sup>G.</sup> <br> I have fantasies of sharing <em>(or breaking, if you will,) </em> bread <em> (a baguette) </em>with a crush of mine, not much <br> unlike how I imagine the lady and the tramp first brushed lips slurping on a fine strand of lightly <br> sauced spaghett. I wonder if people in France bring out baguettes with burning candles instead of birthday <br> cakes. Some breads are cakes in essence, but it would be pretty weird to put cheese on banana bread, <br>for example. In my opinion, it would be weird to put cheese on apple pie, but I guess people still do that. <br>To conclude, 13 year olds are annoying, wine is a truth serum, and it honestly goes great with bread.<br> Here are some things that I love more than bread though:

	<p style="font-family: papyrus; color:aquamarine;"> Anyways, have you ever thought about how beer is effectively just bread water...?</p>
